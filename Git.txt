GIT: GLOBAL INFORMATION TRACKER.

VCS: VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM
It will keep the code separately for each version.

v-1 : 100 lines ---> store (repo-1)
v-2 : 200 lines ---> store (repo-2)
v-3 : 300 lines ---> store (repo-3)

REPO: It is a folder where we store our code.
index.html: It is a basic file for every application.

v1 ---> index.html
v2 ---> index.html
v3 ---> index.html

CVCS: CENTRALIZED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM
EX: SVN: it can store code on a single repo.

DVCS: DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM
EX: GIT: it can store code on Multiple repo.

ROLLBACK: Going back to the previous version of the application.

STAGES:
WORKING DIRECTORY: where we write our source code.
STAGING AREA: we track files here.
REPOSITORY: where we store tracked source code.



WORKING WITH GIT:

create a ec2 server:
mkdir swiggy
cd swiggy

Install Git:
yum install git -y   [yum=pkg manager, install=action, git=pkg name, -y=yes]
git -v               : to check version
git init             : to install .git (local repo)

Steps to create and manage a file in Git:

To create a file: vim index.html (content is opt)

To check status: git status

To track the file: git add index.html

To check status again: git status

To store the file: git commit -m "commit-1" index.html

Summary:  create a file --> add --> commit


To show commits: git log

To show last 2 commits: git log -2

To show commits in a single line: git log -2 --oneline
